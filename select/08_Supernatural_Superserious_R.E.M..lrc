[00:00.26] Everybody here
[00:03.76] Comes from somewhere
[00:07.01] But they would just as soon forget
[00:11.84] And disguise
[00:17.84] 
[00:15.72] At the summer camp where you volunteered
[00:19.67] No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
[00:23.41] If that apparition had just appeared
[00:27.25] Took you up and away from this place
[00:30.18] And sheer humiliation
[00:34.23] Of your teenage station
[00:45.73] 
[00:40.00] Nobody cares
[00:41.45] No one remembers and nobody cares
[00:57.95] 
[00:47.16] Yeah, you cried and you cried
[00:51.21] He's alive, he's alive
[00:55.28] Ah, you cried and you cried
[00:57.27] And you cried and you cried
[01:10.77] 
[01:05.79] If you call out safe then I'll stop right away
[01:09.61] If the premise buckles
[01:11.40] And the ropes start to shake
[01:25.40] 
[01:13.32] For the details mark
[01:15.40] With the stories the same
[01:16.86] You don't have to explain
[01:19.03] You don't have to explain
[01:21.23] Humiliation
[01:24.25] Of your teenage station
[01:35.75] 
[01:29.60] Yeah, you cried and you cried
[01:33.31] He's alive, he's alive
[01:37.35] Ah, you cried and you cried
[01:39.41] And you cried
[01:45.91] 
[01:40.24] And you realized your fantasies are
[01:45.12] Dressed up in travesties
[01:48.37] Enjoy yourself with no regrets
[02:03.37] 
[02:01.12] Everybody here
[02:04.63] Comes from somewhere
[02:07.92] If they would just as soon forget
[02:13.03] And disguise
[02:19.03] 
[02:17.61] Yeah, you cried and you cried
[02:21.64] He's alive, he's alive
[02:25.58] Yeah, you cried and you cried
[02:27.20] And you cried and you cried
[02:40.70] 
[02:29.28] (Oh, you cried and you cried)
[02:33.08] (Oh you cried and you cried)
[02:47.08] 
[02:35.85] Now there's nothing dark and there's nothing weird
[02:39.64] Don't be afraid I will hold you near
[02:43.59] From the séance where you first betrayed
[02:47.84] An open heart on a darkened stage's celebration
[02:54.41] Of your teenage station
[03:05.91] 
[02:59.29] Zen experience, sweet delirious
[03:03.15] Supernatural superserious
[03:07.32] Inexperience, sweet delirious
[03:10.82] Supernatural superserious
[03:14.94] Wow

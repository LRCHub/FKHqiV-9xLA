Come on
Stormy night, cloudy sky
In the moment, you and I
One more chance
너와 나 다시 한번 만나게
서로에게 향하게
My feeling's getting deeper
내 심박수를 믿어
우리 인연은 깊어
I gotta see the meaning of it
I don't know what we've done
되돌아가긴 싫어
もう知っている
Don't know what we've been sold
見つけられるよ
So it's sure
Golden moon, diamond stars
In a moment, you and I
Second chance, しょうがない
もう少し待って
너와 내게 향하게
My feeling's getting deeper
내 심박수를 믿어
우리 인연은 깊어
I gotta see the meaning of it
I don't know what we've done
되돌아가긴 싫어
もう知っている
Don't know what we've been sold
見つけられるよ
So it's sure
It's supernatural
It's supernatural
거짓말 안 할래
너도 말해
Attention we should pay
To what is coming through
We had no idea,
it's crystal clear
Love is here,
sitting next to you
私とあなた
Golden moon, diamond stars
In a moment, we unite

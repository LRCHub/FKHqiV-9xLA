You know she's lost her mind for good this time
Every thought's dragged around with a weight behind
She sees herself in need of repair
Maybe someone'll help her lay her soul down bare

If you see the indication, never compromising
Short of wonder, I wouldn't be surprised
Her lilac breath reminds me I'm dead

She gives a sign, doesn't mind being stalked
Tension dissolves, she's taking off her socks
Draws in the sky, doesn't mind me at all
Curls up and away then the line dissolves

Without reservation, I sail a course
Exploration, a supernatural force
Wide eyes grow at what I detect

Pulling us both into the pretend
Glorious connection due to end
Advertising innocence, floating in the air
Unearth the seed, blew it up and it scattered everywhere

If there's gonna be trouble tonight
You can meet me at the usual place
If there's gonna be a fight tonight
Remember what you said to my face

Oh darling
Too many words have been spoken
I don't wanna get my heart broken
Like lovers do

No more songs tonight
I'm driving to the break of day
No more words tonight
We've got enough to throw away

Oh darling
Now that we two are together
Don't dream this could go on forever
Like lovers do

I can hear you singing on my supernatural radio
I hear you singing on my supernatural radio

Oh darling
Too many words have been spoken
I don't wanna get my heart broken
Like lovers do

One-hundred million watts
Yeah I'm picking up a signal
Yeah it's 100 million watts--raw power
I can hear Jesus singing on my supernatural radio

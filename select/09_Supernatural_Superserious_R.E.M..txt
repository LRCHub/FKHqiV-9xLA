Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
But they would just as soon forget
And disguise
At the summer camp where you volunteered
No one saw your face, no one saw your fear
If that apparition had just appeared
Took you up and away from this place
And sheer humiliation
Of your teenage station
Nobody cares, no one remembers and nobody cares
How you cried and you cried
"He's alive, he's alive"
How you cried and cried
And you cried and you cried
If you call out "safe"
Then I'll stop right away
If the premise buckles
And the ropes start to chafe
The details smart
But the story's the same
You don't have to explain
You don't have to explain
Humiliation
Of your teenage station
Yeah, you cried and you cried
"He's alive, he's alive"
How you cried and you cried
And you cried and you
Realized your fantasies
Are dressed up in travesties
Enjoy yourself with no regrets
Everybody here
Comes from somewhere
That they would just as soon forget
And disguise
Yeah, you cried and you cried
"He's alive, he's alive"
Yeah, you cried and you cried
And you cried and you cried
(Oh, you cried and you cried)
(Oh, you cried and you cried)
Now there's nothing dark
And there's nothing weird
Don't be afraid, I will hold you near
From the seance where you first betrayed
An open heart on a darkened stage
A celebration
Of your teenage station
It's an experience, sweet, delirious
Supernatural, super serious
An experience, sweet, delirious
Supernatural, super serious
Wow

Your love, your love
Supernatural thing
Your love, your love
Supernatural thing, oh, babe

Your love (your love, your love)
Supernatural thing (supernatural)
Oh, baby (supernatural)

Your love, your love
(Your love, your love)
Supernatural thing (supernatural)
Mmm, baby (supernatural)

When we touch, you give me such
A funny feeling in my brain
I'm so possessed by your love
Sometimes I don't even know my name

When we kiss
You know you make me hot
I break out sometimes
In little bitty green spots

You give me
Give me all you got
Don't stop it, baby
'Cause I need a lot

Your love (your love, your love)
Lord, it's a supernatural thing
(Supernatural) oh, woman
(Supernatural)

Your love, your love
(Your love, your love)
Supernatural thing (supernatural)
Mmm hmm (supernatural)

Interplanetary, extraordinary love
(Interplanetary) what you say
(Extraordinary) hey (supernatural)
I like it (supernatural) listen
Interplanetary, extraordinary love

I like it
(Extraordinary) like the way you love me
(Supernatural) oh, baby (supernatural)

You give me cosmic feeling
Every time that I squeeze you
You love is so electrifying
So satisfying
Lord knows I ain't lying

Your love (your love, your love)
Supernatural thing (supernatural)
Oh, woman (supernatural)
Your love (your love, your love)
Lord, it's a supernatural thing
(Supernatural) what you say
(Supernatural)
